001	Journal	Personal Growth	Reflective	Reflect on your first day of work by describing your experiences, what you learned, any insights you gained, and any challenges you faced.  Share your hopes and goals for this internship. To make your reflection vivid and engaging, consider describing your workplace in detail; what does it look and feel like? Who are the people around you? Who is your supervisor. You might also answer questions like: how was your role clarified? What specific duties will you have?	Undaunted is a company I am very familiar with. This summer, I first interned with them working 50-hour weeks for over two months. After a busy summer, Undaunted gave me a job offer that I accepted to work part time for them after school. Working for them went quite well; through all of September and October I was able to accomplish a very daunting task. I took the payload on the back of the dog (originally a plain black electrical box), and completely redesigned it to be more professional, redundant, and easier to access. I did this through advanced 3D design (CAD) and 3D printing. My first day back was awesome. I got to catch up with all the people who I hadn't seen much in person since the summer. I also got to meet two of the new full-time repairmen, Mark and Rashaad. Today's work can be best described as re-onboarding as my time was split between 3 tasks.  Dog Photoshoot One of the things I will be working on over this internship is kicking off paid advertisements for Undaunted. For this I was responsible for filming and compiling a collection of shots of the robotic dog and its doghouse. I made a list of different shots and went out into the field and filmed these. I also got and applied special stickers to the side of one of the dogs for this advertisement (the “SECURITY” on the dog’s midsection). I even got to use the new Ray-Ban Meta AI glasses which enabled me to control the dog with my phone and film it with the glasses all at the same time. Financial Modeling One of the best ways to understand and re-acclimate with a company is to understand how it functions on the financial side. For this task, Bryan gave me a list of parameters such as rate of sales, acceleration of sales, revenue per contract, customer retention rate, cost per contract, people’s salaries, etc. As of now I have roughly 20 variables but I expect this number to grow into 50 ish before I am done with this. Doghouse Bluetooth control My engineering warm-up task is to configure the doghouse computers that control the door to be operational via bluetooth, ensuring the dog remains accessible in the event of a cellular connectivity failure (a common issue). I set up a bluetooth server on the doghouse computer and will continue to work on this and eventually integrate this into the Undaunted dashboard.
002	Article	Science and Technology	Informative	Tell me about the company you work at.	Undaunted makes Atlanta safer. By leveraging advanced robotics and AI, Undaunted is able to provide more effective security to places that can't afford traditional security guards. A 24/7 security guard in Atlanta will run you about $200,000 a year, Undaunted secures it's customers for a fourth of that. How undaunted works is for every site we secure, we will have two robotic dogs outfitted with cameras and a speaker. A human monitoring team will surveil the area remotely by plugging into existing security cameras, and when action is needed, these personnel can deploy the dogs remotely to address any situation that may arise. The vast majority of Undaunted's customer base today is leasing homes in crime heavy areas of Atlanta. I love visiting these places and interacting with the people we serve. Every time I visit for a repair or upgrade people always come up to me and are always awestruck at how cool and capable the robotic dogs are.

How do you talk to potential customers and research ideas effectively, without biasing who you interact with? This is what The Mom Test covers. While I am not starting a new company and doing research for that, I am doing research and talking with people about ideas constantly. Today I was crafting the revenue portion of the financial model and I was getting feedback on what I had done already from Bryan. The Mom Test teaches that when getting feedback, one should never bias the correspondent by tying the creation (or company idea in the case of the book) to yourself as that leads to response bias or people just being polite and lying. Therefore, I would ask for advise about specific sections and choices in neutral ways. I avoided questions like ""What do you think about my decision to break down yearly retention rates into monthly rates?"" If I had asked this question and my choice had been suboptimal, Bryan could have potentially felt obligated or that he needs to be polite and not given me his actual thoughts on how to make it better. From the first few chapters The Mom Test has taught me how to seek advice from people in ways which are most fruitful."
004	Journal	Personal Growth	Reflective	Describe and reflect on your work from today, what you learned, what insights you gained and any challenges you faced.	"Today I began by finalizing the financial model. This model ultimately reached 8 unique tabs that broke down larger topics, such as costs, into smaller more digestible pieces. Originally I went about this trying to stuff everything into one single sheet but Bryan suggested a more modular approach for both readability along with the ability to modify it in the future. This project took a lot of time and I was stuck on the math of calculating the quantity of contracts after factoring in renewal rates. Ultimately, I had to draw it out on a scratch piece of paper and remember some niche 10th grade math to get it right. For context here is what the equation ended up being. ""=P6+('Revenue Information'!$B$6*Q2+'Revenue Information'!$B$5) - ('Revenue Information'!$B$5 + E2 *'Revenue Information'!$B$6)*(1-'Revenue Information'!$B$7)."" To break this down briefly this is the previous months revenue (P6) plus the base contract sales per month (Revenue Information'!$B$5) added to the acceleration in contracts per month (Revenue Information'!$B$6*Q2). All this so far is the total contracts, factoring in renewal rates I had to subtract the number of contracts from 12 months ago multiplied by 1 - the customer renewel rate. Through this challenging equation and others I was eventually able to complete a full business model that lined up with Bryan's model. Here is a link to a copy of the spreadsheet with randomized values (as to not reveal any sensitive information about Undaunted). Unduanted Financial Model - Randomized."

Rob Fitzpatrick writes ""You should be terrified of compliments (chapter 2)"" in reference to conversations with customers. This is because if you are complimented, it likely means you somehow tied yourself to whatever topic is being discussed. In order to get the most truthful, and in-turn most valuable data, from conversations, it is important that whoever you are talking to does not feel the need to lie out of being polite. If I pitch someone my idea and ask them what they think, 95 times out of 100 they would say something along the lines of ""Oh wow! that's such a great idea!"", but if you can dance around the idea and talk about what problems they have and if they have tried other solutions, you can gain valuable insight into what business ideas would really work."
006	Journal	Science and Technology	Reflective	Describe and reflect on your work from today, what you learned, what insights you gained and any challenges you faced.	"I have come to the point where I have sufficiently tested development versions of my implementation of Bluetooth controlled doghouse doors. This functions is via a special web page on Google Chrome that I made; this page uses Chrome's Bluetooth feature and this lets me search for devices within range. Once the Bluetooth server is set up on the doghouse computer, this Chrome tab can connect to the computer and send messages. If the Bluetooth server receives a message with ""open"" or ""close,"" it executes the necessary code to open or close the doghouse door. While this task is already relatively complex, what makes it really challenging is incorporating it within the current codebase in an organized and sustainable manner. If I was to just copy and paste all my prototyping code in, it wouldn't follow the standards of the codebase and it would be promptly rejected by Chris. In order to meet these standards, I need to have my code function like preexisting code. One example of what this looks like is there is a setup file that is run to set up new doghouses. In this setup file there is a special command that installs a bunch of necessary digital components (dependencies) from a requirements text file. In order to include all the digital components I used, I had to modify this requirements text file to include the new Bluetooth digital components. Another example of this is to run the Bluetooth server continuously (even after it crashes or the computer is restarted), I need to operate a service at a system level on the computer. Other files are run like this already and I had to use the exact same methodology in order to place these files in the correct area and ensure everything was understandable and traceable in case this caused any errors. Overall this process of working with professional codebases is great practice for serious computer science projects that I hope to pursue in college."

This includes Bryan's regular calls with customers, leads, and mentors, during which he often pulls Chris or me into the conversation. Bryan swears by The Mom Test, and after listening to many hours of his conversations, I can see him apply the lessons to real business. For example, chapter four emphasizes listening more than speaking by asking questions that encourage specific reflection rather than shallow generalizations. Bryan is an expert at this. Recently when he was asked how his holidays went, he mentioned the topic of spending time with parents as they age, which relaxed the mood and the person he was talking to open up about some of his personal life. When the conversation inevitably shifts to the business at hand, this earlier, more personal discussion establishes a connection between Bryan and the other person increasing the likelihood of a successful sale or a happy customer.
008	Journal	Personal Growth	Reflective	Describe and reflect on your work from today, what you learned, what insights you gained and any challenges you faced.	Being in the Undaunted office is fun. It is fun for two reasons: first, I have a purpose. The work I do actively helps make Atlanta safer and protects those that have the least. Second, the culture is golden. I probably have around 40 conversations an hour. Some of those 40 are technical, where I’m asking for advice. Today that looked like me consulting Kieran (mechanical engineer) on how he controlled the linear actuator of the doghouse through a computer. He assisted me with the wiring, the frequency of communication from the computer to the motor driver (the electrical chip that converts numbers into voltage for the motor), and about the Supabase config file (which stores configuration data for each doghouse in an accessible cloud database). Some of those conversations involve others asking me questions. Over the summer, I designed the manufacturing process for the onboard computers for the robotic dogs function. Consequently I am the most knowledgeable about things relating to computer set-up, and I frequently assisted Mark and Rishab (technicians) on how to navigate the nuances or special cases of manufacturing the computers. Another part of these conversations has no purpose whatsoever. Oftentimes, Bryan (CEO) will finish a call or meeting and say something absolutely preposterous just to talk to people. Today I remember him coming back into the office and stating that he screwed up. What he is referring to is how he forgot to fire and rehire Chris as he had officially been working with Undaunted for one year as of today and therefore his employee options contracts (a deal that allows an employee to earn a percentage of the company over time) had officially begun. This broke the thin layer of ice and got everyone talking for a while. Where this community is especially potent is during lunch, everyone gets together (and sometimes, like today, Max joins us) and we will all talk about tons of things from new year’s resolutions, to how college preparation compares to real world jobs, along with professional paintball (Rishab played professionally for two years). It is this culture that I absolutely love and why I can’t wait to get to work each day.

Be specific by including quotes, examples, or key ideas from the text.	"While I was on a call with Bryan a few weeks before Janterm, he said something interesting. He told me that the area where I could use more experience was sales. Originally Bryan had proposed that I fully commit to sales and effectively do door-to-door sales at different leasing offices throughout high-crime neighborhoods in Atlanta. While I was willing to do this, Bryan and Chris eventually pivoted my task for two reasons. First, multiple Undaunted sites had experienced shootings before Undaunted was hired so Bryan did not want to put me at risk. Second, Bryan thought that the task of succeeding in the business-to-business sales cycle is one that takes many weeks of relationship-building. Because I would only be available for three weeks he thought that I simply wouldn't have the time to build meaningful customer connections. I often think about how to sell and the last few chapters I have provided a nice framework for this. First, I have learned how to identify and secure meetings. Fitzpatrick argues that ""slicing"" your potential customer base into different groups enables more effective sales. To use one of his examples, if you were to sell an app to people to track their workouts, one effective way to do this is to target those committed enough to attend the gym during a lunch break. He proposes showing up in the gym and discreetly talking with potential customers in order to understand their problems and eventually attempt to solve them. Applying this to Undaunted, I could potentially look at Atlanta crime data by county and search for all registered housing complexes in that county then visit or attempt to contact the property manager of each in order to sell Undaunted's service."
010	Journal	Society and Culture	Reflective	Describe and reflect on your work from today, what you learned, what insights you gained and any challenges you faced.	The power of community. The Atlanta Tech Village is a special place. Entrepreneurship can be a long and hard road. There are no set hours, no guaranteed paycheck, and no one to blame if things go wrong. The Atlanta Tech Village is a community for people on this path. Instead of having hundreds of startups spread all over Atlanta, this large group of startups can all come together in one place. Because of the Atlanta Tech Village, Undaunted has found mentors, partners, and received invaluable introductions. Bryan and Chris of Undaunted often have meetings with mentors in the community who have either run large companies or built successful startups. One meeting recently Chris invited me to was with the chief technical officer for a multibillion-dollar business, and he provided interesting opinions and advice on how Chris was navigating engineering at Undaunted. One of Chris’s and my biggest takeaways from the meeting was to build unit tests (automated tests for websites to ensure they function properly). This ensured that we could build things quickly and also easily confirm that everything still worked properly as we added more and more complexity to the website. In terms of networking, because Undaunted works at the Atlanta Tech Village, they have met others who know property owners in Atlanta who would be the target customer for Undaunted and have provided warm introductions to those people. This is a mechanism to get sales that is orders of magnitudes more effective than simple cold calls or emails. Another feature is simply the exposure; people will often stop by the office when they are giving a tour or if they are in the area. I have met Mayor Andre Dickens and one of Georgia’s representatives in the United States House of Representatives without notice because they simply visited or toured the place and they happened to stop by the Undaunted office (see getundaunted.com for the photo of Bryan, the robotic dog, and the mayor). This exposure is great for marketing, and very importantly legitimizes these small businesses.

Be specific by including quotes, examples, or key ideas from the text.	One facet of customer discovery that isn’t immediately obvious is how you communicate your learnings to the rest of a company. The Mom Test dedicates an entire chapter to this topic, and I found it very interesting. Fitzpatrick talks about how, in one of his first companies, he would regularly have customer conversations and after each one he would return to the engineering team and ask them to completely pivot and build something new. He did this because a single customer wanted it or claimed they would find it valuable. Fitzpatrick explains that this eventually led to the CTO (Chief Technical Officer) leaving the company due to the lack of a clear strategy around customer discovery.  While Fitzpatrick didn’t recognize the lack of clear engineering strategy at the time, the way he briefed his team made it seem like every piece of feedback required immediate action. He proposes a new framework to better inform teams and transfer learning from the person doing customer discovery to the people building the product. His suggestion is that, once a week, the person doing customer discovery should spend 30 minutes to an hour in a weekly meeting summarizing what they learned and discussing potential changes. Fitzpatrick emphasizes that identifying customer problems is critical, but that it is not always best to listen to a customer’s advice on how to solve those problems. Often, it is more effective to clearly understand the problem and then work on solving it yourself, since most people don’t have the technical experience or actually know what they want.  Bryan at Undaunted does a good job of relaying information from customers to the rest of the team. After calls, he will often summarize them in under a minute if they are bland or if he found it particularly interesting we will all spend more time on it and discuss whether our strategy should change.
012	Essay	Personal Growth	Reflective	How is your internship different from learning at school normally?	Learning at School vs. Learning at Undaunted I find that the type of learning I do at Westminster is very different from the learning and work I do at Undaunted. At Westminster, learning is very orderly. Take a math unit, for example: we start by learning how to solve a certain type of problem, then practice solving those problems. This cycle of learning and practicing repeats for maybe a week, and then finally we are assessed on how well we can solve the problems we’ve learned throughout the week.  At Undaunted, this is nothing like how I work. I’m effectively only given an end goal, such as creating a financial model or building a Bluetooth server to open doghouse doors. Going back to the math unit analogy, this feels like being given the final unit test at the very beginning and being told to figure it out.  I think the biggest difference between these two types of learning is conceptual understanding versus efficiency. In school, I generally understand conceptual ideas better, but it takes significantly longer. Theoretically, if I were just given a math test, I could probably figure it out in two days of classes instead of five, but I doubt I would have the same depth of understanding as I do after learning and practicing repeatedly. On the other hand, I bet I could understand the technology that I build more intuitively if I took twice the time to construct the things I build at work.  Ultimately, this comes down to the different objectives of school and work. In school, my goal is to learn new topics. At Undaunted, my goal is to help make Atlanta safer. Both goals are valid and make sense. While they are somewhat opposite, they fit different stages of life. I see school as the time to prepare for the real world, and working in the real world as the time to use school’s practice to influence the world.
013	Journal	Personal Growth	Reflective	"How is ""adulting"" at your internship and how does it compare to normal habits at school?"	Real World Work Habits Continuing the trend of comparing my work to school, another topic I want to talk about is how the work habits differ. Westminster is very orderly. I have assignments and deadlines. Undaunted is not like this. I do not know whether this is just the culture of a small startup or the nature of companies and business as a whole, but there are no deadlines, no tests, no assignments, no defined start to the day, no end to the day, no being tardy, no strict 35-minute block to eat lunch, and no dress code.  I like to arrive around 8:30 a.m. every day, but for the rest of the team most arrive around 9:30 or 10:00 a.m., and everyone is free to leave whenever. Half the days I leave around 3:00 or 4:00 to get to Westminster squash practice on time, yet on days when I do not have practice I’ve stayed until around 6:00, and everyone is still there.  I do not know if this is my personality, but this feels far more freeing. I am not at the mercy of being late to class anymore. Instead, everyone simply trusts each other to get their work done. This removes a lot of everyday school stress.  On a smaller note, as a growing teenage boy I eat a lot, and the 35-minute lunches we sometimes have are not sufficient for me to finish the multiple plates of food I get. At Undaunted, I do not have this problem.  I will say that I am not sure this level of freedom would function at a larger company. I think it only works because the close-knit group of about five people are all deeply dedicated. No one is slacking off or looking for an excuse to leave early. Each person truly finds purpose and meaning in what they accomplish each day.

Be specific by including quotes, examples, or key ideas from the text.	I have just finished The Mom Test by Rob Fitzpatrick, and I think it was great at teaching me about the world of researching customer problems and selling a business’s products. I have a few key takeaways that I believe will help me when I one day start my own company.  First, never introduce your ego when you are looking for feedback. Introducing your ego into a situation where you are trying to get feedback invites whoever you are talking to to lie out of politeness. Introducing your ego can turn good data into corrupt data that means nothing. This is especially critical during customer discovery, as false data could lead you to waste months of your life going nowhere.  A second big takeaway for me is to ask for concrete commitments from people as a measure of how much they like an idea or would be willing to try it. Commitments do not always come in the form of money. They can be introductions, reviews, product trials, or contracts. People will say almost anything, but once they have to commit something of value to the idea, that becomes a true measure of their opinion and the perceived value of your business.  Finally, one of my big takeaways is to research and find areas of great pain for even a small number of people. Oftentimes, people build products that do not truly solve anything or are merely gimmicks. If you can solve a real problem cost-effectively and intuitively, you can get a business to work.  I believe that reading this book has opened my eyes to the value of customer conversations, and I will surely reflect on and possibly reread this book when the time comes for me to go through the same process Fitzpatrick describes of founding a company and doing the critical research.
015	Journal	Science and Technology	Reflective	What challenges do you face working at Undaunted?	Challenges regarding the Bluetooth controlled doghouse door Building things is hard. Often, no one in the history of humanity has ever built what you are trying to build. “Building a system to operate a robotic dog’s doghouse door via Bluetooth as a redundant measure in case Wi-Fi fails”, is almost certainly a quote that has never existed before this moment. These things are hard because there are no instructions. In school, we are often taught how to accomplish a task, then we spend time practicing that task, and finally on assessments we have to complete small variations of that task. The real engineering world is nothing like that. An engineer knows only the intended final functionality, and must figure out how to build a system to achieve that. There are no office hours with experts, no online worksheets and practice problems, and unlike STEM classes, how you get a final answer matters. Given a math question, I could take many ways to get to a final answer and if it was correct I would get full credit. For engineering, it is not just about getting something to work, but doing so in a cost-effective, easy-to-manufacture, and time-efficient manner. So far, the key for me being a successful engineer has been raw perseverance and not being afraid to ask for help.  Consistent Bluetooth Connectivity Ensuring that Bluetooth was always powered on and discoverable even after crashes and loss-of-power was a difficult task. It involved testing many different methods such as modifying low level service files and changing the Bluetooth server. Eventually I landed on setting system settings in the install file.  Jerky Motor Movement When I first got the doghouse computer to move on Bluetooth messages, the motor that controlled the dog house moved very jerky. I changed the communication frequency to the motor controller, tried a new motor controller and even replaced the motor, yet none of these fixes resolved the issues it was having. Eventually I consulted another engineer and he proposed that it might be a conflict with two files trying to control the motor at once. Testing this he was right and I changed the code so that the motor is only controlled by files when an action is requested.  IOS Chrome Features I made a website on chrome that used chrome bluetooth api to connect to the computer. After I had made this I wanted to test it on my phone. After some research I learned that all Chrome on IOS does not have bluetooth features like the computer. Learning this, I pivoted my strategy and I am working on integrating with an app that lets you send Bluetooth messages.
016	Journal	Personal Growth	Reflective	Describe one ah-ha moment during your internship.	My A-Ha Moment One A-ha moment for me during this internship has been the economics of engineering and how, when you have an at-scale business, you can amortize costs across many customers. Take a simple example: if you have 100 deployed robot dogs and can decrease the amount of repairs by 5%, that can save a very sizable amount of money. On the other hand, if you only have 10 robot dogs, decreasing repair time by 5% does not make much economic sense, and probably is not worth your time. This ability becomes very powerful once you reach larger and larger scales, an engineer’s work can become super-levered. If Undaunted reaches 500 robots, even a 1% decrease in the number of repairs can lead to significant increases in activity of dogs and decreases in cost. This lesson is especially interesting because I think it will help me when interviewing for jobs in the future. If I find myself interviewing for an engineering or computer science position, I can use this framework to explain how I would add value at scale across all of an enterprise’s customers, and how taking me on as an intern or hiring me would be an intelligent financial and economic decision.  Today I continued working on the Bluetooth-controlled doghouse door. I experimented with Bluefy, an iOS app similar to Chrome that allows you to enable and connect to local Bluetooth devices. I successfully used my phone, without Wi-Fi and only Bluetooth, to open and close the doghouse door. From here, I need to work on integrating it into the Undaunted website, which will be a challenge given that it is a large codebase with many rules and constraints. I also took time to reorganize the manufacturing corner of the office after we moved a few days ago. There was a lot of equipment lying around, and we received two new shelves today, which I assembled and used to organize everything in a way that is space-efficient while still easy to access.

The book argues that in competitive markets, all the money to be made is competed away. Taking airlines as an example, global airlines will generate an estimated $1 trillion in revenue in 2025, yet they are worth only a couple hundred billion dollars combined. If we look at something like Google, on the other hand, Google will generate around $400 billion in revenue, yet it is worth about four trillion.  This is due to competition. For airlines, the product is all approximately the same: it quickly transports people from point A to point B. The real issue is that there are many major airlines all competing for customers. They compete by lowering costs and providing more expensive services, ultimately destroying their potential profits. Google, on the other hand, has a near-monopoly on search with roughly two-thirds market share. This allows it to capture huge value.  If we zoom out and look purely at the value these businesses provide to the world, it is reasonable to say that air travel is far more critical than Google Search (its main business) or Google’s other projects. Yet, due to fierce competition in airlines, there is very little money to be made there, while Google can capture a sizable chunk of the value it creates, making it significantly more valuable. Ultimately, by having few competitors, Google is able to generate outsized returns when compared to hyper competitive industries, even if those competitive industries provide a greater value to the world.  This chapter shifted my perspective on competition in business. I used to think of competition as honorable and necessary, but now I understand that it should be avoided whenever possible. Applying this to Undaunted, it would be short-sighted to compete directly with traditional security companies, as providers would likely just lower costs and no one would make money. A more defensible long-term business could be built by targeting new, untapped markets rather than competing with existing security providers.
018	Journal	Personal Growth	Reflective	Write about something you have been thinking about.	How Crazy is a Gap year? I never really considered this until now, but I have the opportunity to potentially take a gap year with Undaunted. They have been generous enough, and impressed by my skills, to offer me a full-time role next year between high school and college. When I first received this offer, I dismissed it. I thought there was no way I would delay going to college to work at a startup for a year. Even though I enjoy it, I did not see myself working somewhere for only a year and then leaving it behind. I feel like I am more of an all-or-nothing type of person.  Upon further thought, it could make sense. What really got me thinking about it was the book Zero to One. It argues that great companies are exceedingly rare, and that founders or potential founders often make the mistake of not being early to an incredible company, instead chasing the small chance that they will succeed on their own. While I believe I can succeed, I also believe that Undaunted is an incredible company (potentially once in a lifetime) doing important work for Atlanta and could be worth an incredible amount in a decade.  After a discussion with Bryan, the CEO, he said that I would receive stock options (basically a small ownership in Undaunted along with payment) should I take a gap year with them. That made this especially interesting. Today, Undaunted is worth a relatively small amount and raised money at a valuation of a few million dollars. I sincerely believe it has a real chance of surpassing 50 or even 100 million dollars in the next five to ten years. I wonder to myself: is this my shot?

Be specific by including quotes, examples, or key ideas from the text.	Zero to One mentions a particularly critical moment in a company’s history: the foundation. The foundation sets the scene for everything that is to come. A poor start almost never leads to a great end. This is due to many factors, but I think one of the largest is culture. Culture is something that is malleable when tiny (by tiny I mean an absolute maximum of three people), yet becomes as rooted as a tree as a team grows. There have been new CEOs and new heads of organizations that try to change culture and are unable to do so within a decade. I will note that it may be possible with mass layoffs, but this is an extremely traumatic process that most startups will not survive.  Founding a company is like marriage. Brian and Chris joke about this at Undaunted, and I believe it to be true. Once you commit to a company with someone else, it is messy to change, yet if both people in the relationship can work together, they can change the world.  Another topic Zero to One discusses regarding the foundation of a company is role allocation. Oftentimes, when personnel compete for the same role, it can lead to destructive behavior. At large companies, this can usually be directed toward progress, yet at a startup, strife and divisions within the company can spell its doom.  From this perspective, I think Brian and Chris made the right call in career marriage. They have gotten used to, and enjoy, spending over eight hours a day with each other. They each take unique, distinctive, and equally important roles in the company: Chris focuses on making the product, and Brian focuses on convincing others to buy it. Interestingly, each also plays a critical role in the other’s work. Chris runs great demonstrations and has landed multiple contracts worth many tens of thousands of dollars, and Bryan’s vision for how a customer interacts with a product is second to none.
020	Journal	Personal Growth	Reflective	Write about something interesting from your experience at your internship today.	How to Engage the Customer? Our weekly team meetings always starts with Bryan's large updates. These can cover topics from potential new sales to new initiatives and anything he wants to bring up with the team. Today, it was all about our meetings with customers and customer success. As of today, we have bi-weekly meetings with every single customer. This isn’t attended by everyone, but it’s something that happens, and someone on the monitoring team always attends and writes the relevant data from the last few weeks and Undaunted performance as a whole. This is great for showing customers that Undaunted is working and really building a relationship with them. On the other hand, it takes a lot of their time, and it’s getting to a point where many sites simply no-show.  Today, everyone had a discussion on how we should reorganize this so that customers engage with us and so that we aren’t wasting their time as well. We came up with a new structure: before rollout day and until two months after rollout day, there are bi-weekly meetings. At the beginning, these meetings are especially important to confirm simple things such as electrical, where they want us to patrol, as well as to set expectations for how the next year will go. After the first month or two, everything is in place, and these meetings become significantly less critical. It more becomes similar to data review than any actionable requests.  What we decided is to eliminate the bi-weekly meetings after two months and transition to a monthly schedule until month five, and then finally a quarterly schedule. The reason we structured it as such is to both prioritize the time of our customers as well as have a meeting right before the renewal date, in hopes that they see all the progress in crime Undaunted has prevented and they’re incentivized to renew. Another thing we added was a $1,000 bonus to any customers who have perfect attendance through all these meetings.
021	Essay	Science and Technology	Reflective	Summarize what you learned through your reading and explain how it connects to your internship. This could include how the reading helps you understand specific tasks or challenges, how it influences your approach to work or relates to the broader field in which you are involved. Be specific by including quotes, examples, or key ideas from the text.	Zero to One rejects the common trope of humans versus AI and argues that humans plus AI will be superior well into the 22nd century, citing an example from PayPal in the early 2000s. PayPal was growing rapidly and generating significant revenue, yet it was still losing money overall due to credit card fraud. It wasn’t feasible for humans to review tens of thousands of transactions every second, and while leveraging the best machine learning models worked temporarily, fraudsters were able to test and pivot their methods and eventually get around the computers. What ultimately worked for PayPal was a mix of humans and computers, where computers flagged the transactions most likely to be fraudulent and a strong human team made the final decision. This human-plus-AI system allowed PayPal to go from losing millions of dollars to making millions of dollars.   This illustrates Zero to One’s larger claim that pure AI or pure human systems are never as effective as human-in-the-loop systems, where humans handle the rare and unpredictable edge cases that AI can’t grasp. This book was written in 2014, and I find it interesting to compare this idea to an emerging AI technology: self-driving cars. These systems have existed and performed well since the 2010s, yet they have consistently struggled with rare edge cases (such as encountering a road closure where the car must follow the hand signals of a construction worker instead of a traffic light). These challenges delayed full deployment until recently, and even now companies like Waymo still rely on human intervention when the AI becomes confused.  The power of humans plus AI is also true for Undaunted. While many may assume that in today’s golden age of AI Undaunted relies solely on fully automated robot dog patrols and agentic camera monitoring, the company goes against the general consensus and employs humans alongside AI. They do this because when it comes to security, there is no room for errors or unresolved edge cases. This work truly matters, and humans aided by AI camera vision alerts create the most efficient system for keeping people safe.
022	Narrative	Personal Growth	Reflective	What will your future look like after doing this internship?	My Future I don’t know what the future holds, but Undaunted has given me a window into how I might bring about that future. Interestingly, it’s not the technology or the robotics that has been the most valuable lesson. Instead, it’s been the team. Almost anyone can put their head down and create a functional product with enough effort, yet it is exceedingly rare to find entire teams collaborating and working toward a shared goal.  This is my third internship. After my sophomore year of high school, I interned at another robotics startup. There, I was also able to build really cool technology and learn about the field, yet the culture was rather poor. It was the kind of place where everyone ate lunch alone, everyone left and locked up as soon as 5:00 p.m. rolled around, and while people got stuff done, they were nowhere near as productive as they could have been if they had collaborated and worked with each other. My second internship was after my junior year of high school. This was where I first experienced the culture of a great company. I was incredibly motivated, like the rest of the team, because we were all chasing a shared mission to make Atlanta safer. I remember being at sites that Undaunted served until well past 11:00 p.m. multiple times. I didn’t do this because I was paid (in fact, I wasn’t paid at all). I did this because I loved working with the team and I was definitively making Atlanta safer.  Throughout these hundreds of hours (roughly 800) I’ve spent as an intern, my biggest takeaway isn’t how to build things; it’s how a team should communicate, operate, and perform. One day I will start my own company. Because of Undaunted, I know how I should construct a team and how that team should communicate.
023	Article	Science and Technology	Persuasive	Pitch me on a novel business idea that could be successful.	Imagine a website where you could upload a photo or two of a person and get a high quality roman bust or bobblehead of a friend, yourself, or anyone from history (for $20-50 ish)  Tech - what this looks like is using some free software to construct 3d models of people from simple 2d images and 3d printing these (I have tested this and gotten ok initial results that could def get better if I spent more time).  Distribution- There exists something called 3d printer farms where you can send a file and pay a little money and get high quality prints in any colors or materials. We could do this to pay a pretty cheap cost to get these physical goods once a user uploads a photo and specifies what they want.  Why this could work - this model of using print farms means we are effectively a customized drop shipper. We have to handle significantly less inventory and this requires virtually no continued investment to scale.  Advertising, website making, and reconstruction software are all very doable.
024	Essay	Science and Technology	Informative	Describe a business idea that you have.	We bring data analysis and AI to local Atlanta companies. Theory is that companies without scale likely haven’t/wont hire somebody to take a lot of their data, understand it, and propose business changes to be a more fit company.  An example of where this could be implemented is country clubs ie cherokee or capital city. We could help these companies better understand their members and suggest next construction project ie more pickleball courts. Also could be used to help them choose the best members from their large waitlists. Imagine getting member data about age, profession, number and age of kids, whether they are married, where they live, and using all this to determine which potential members would spend the most time and money at the club.

030	Journal	Personal Growth	Reflective	Who has most influenced your life's goals? Your life's character?	Great great question. I could talk on this for hours on end so I will try to keep this concise and interesting. To preface my life's goals can be distilled into the following lines: Leave the biggest mark on the earth as possible Maximize benefit for humanity Live life to the ABSOLUTE fullest Influences: Dad - My dad has definitely been a big influence inspiring and leading me to really strive for change and make it into a reality. Especially through business, I've learned so much about how to best influence the world and leverage companies to bring creations to life and drive change. Another note he has really introduced me to the world of technology and how powerful that is. Mom - She has been the main person influencing the humanitarian influence. As a former teacher to underserved kids she really understands the human aspect. She has taught me to think about things from all perspectives and how nuanced humanity is as a whole. From my parents, she has brought the human side while my dad has been the innovation-technology-change guy. Philosophy? - this is not a who but has certaintly influenced my outlook on life. Because of Philosophy (and spirituality?) I approach life with the following adages: can't control luck (nihlism in a sense) learn from past but quickly move on In this wild world all I control is the now Nothing is promised - enjoy the current moment Global innovators - Jensen Huang, Mark Zuckerberg, Elon Musk(contributions to humanity - ignore politics), Sundar Pichai, Sam Altman: These few along with countless others have proven how you can significantly change the world and literally build the future. I am so awe-inspired when the frontier of a technology is redefined and furthered. These people have made it happen in our world and the effects are seen every day. I want to be like them. I want to shape the world providing huge value to everyone.
031	Essay	Personal Growth	Reflective	How have the environments or experiences of your upbringing – your family, home, neighborhood, or community – shaped the person you are today?	I think the biggest environmental factor has been my parents. They have been my biggest influence in my development. From my earliest days they have been pushing me to be locked-in, intelligent, and thoughtful about everything in life. I really appreciate the fact that my parents took the time to read to me or just let me ask dumb questions as a small child. My parents have undoubtedly shaped the person I am today by promoting a thoughtful and curious outlook on life.
032	Journal	Personal Growth	Reflective	What would your best friend say are your strongest attributes, and why?	My best friend would say that my strongest attributes are my dedication and novelty. When I get focused on something I am 100% all-in. Whether it is a school project, random game, or pickleball, once I focus it is really hard to derail me. My parents have a word for this saying it is the “Cummings focus”. This is definitely appreciated by my friends, they know that when I direct my energy there is nothing that will distract me or prevent me from reaching a goal. Another thing that my friends would classify as a strong attribute of mine is novelty. I am not very similar to other kids. I have different priorities, act differently, and treat the world differently from the majority of other kids my age. For example, I think I prioritize long-term marginal benefit significantly more than others.
033	Essay	Personal Growth	Reflective	Who are the adults on campus that know you best? What character qualities would they use to describe you?	I think the adults that know me best are Mr. Vuckovic(bio teacher and XC coach), Celia Pashley(Squash coach), and Mrs. Latham (math)  I think a quality all of them would use to describe me is drive, in sports or in classes I am always laser focused on the task at hand. I am sure they all recognize this, especially for the sports coaches. For some reason or another I am most driven and bent on playing to the best of my abilities in sports. Whether it is a simple 7th grade PE, a fun game of ultimate frisbee, or squash, sports bring out a different side of me. I do still think that academic teachers pick up on my drive as I am pretty vocal in math but rarely off topic. Another quality they would use is leader, particularly for the last two. In math I am always first to jump out of their seats to work at the boards. Furthermore, a decent number of people consult me for help when Mrs. Latham is helping someone else. For squash I am the guy who leads workouts and always gets everyone hyped up for matches. While I am not the best on the team people definitely look to me for direction and motivation. Because of this I was voted captain last year for junior year.
034	Narrative	Personal Growth	Reflective	Name 5 random, fun or unique facts about you (please provide details).	I don’t “relax” in the traditional sense - I don’t enjoy doing nothing. My type of vacation consists of hanging out with friends, playing games/sports, and doing whatever unique there is to do at a location. I get 8 hours of sleep every night (mostly) - I really work to do this. Interestingly, I have found that if I don’t get 8 hours I noticeably think slower and my speech can be impaired. Less sleep = more speech errors from me which really pisses me off. I trained a chatGPT-like model to text like me - I took all my texting data from the last few years and formatted it. I then used this to train a model to text how I would text. I released this publicly and made it easy to use (https://www.landoncummings.com/LandonGPT). My friends have found this very fun to play with and have sent it over 350 messages at this point in time. I love building cool things and this is just one of many interesting projects. I am agnostic - This is something I can easily go down a deep deep rabbit hole so if you are more curious ask me in person but I will keep this brief here. Basically I believe that something must have created everything but I’m not sold it is any of the big 3 major world religions. I lived in florida for 9 ish months during covid. This was an unfortunate time for my development socially as I was just isolated (no phone). But on the bright side I dove super deep into a ultra complex strategy game called Yu-Gi-Oh. This is a card game traditionally with a big online community. During this time I trained/played for a while and eventually got to a high level and competed for real money (career winning of $150!).
035	Narrative	Personal Growth	Reflective	How have your life experiences shaped who you are today? Feel free to elaborate on an aspect of your identity, background, or community you are part of.	Living in Florida during the pandemic 6th grade and 7th(when others were in person)- This was a very impactful time. I was completely cut off from my entire Westminster world except for a zoom screen looking at my classes all together. This was a really rough time. My friends for this year were men in between 30-50 through pickleball. I genuinely don’t think I had any interaction with someone my age for months outside of zoom school. Socially I effectively got a hard reset and re-tuned on adults. Coming back in person I was not socially ready at all. Middle school was rough. Towards the end of 8th grade I started to really understand and generalize social experiences. 9th grade was far from clean but significant progress, socially there are a lot of nuances that I had not reached. I think I was fully up to speed and doing well in 10th grade. Socially I’m pretty solid nowadays but that covid gap definitely hurt for a while.
036	Narrative	Personal Growth	Reflective	What two life experiences have had the greatest impact on you and why?	Great-grandfather passing away early 2024 (first major loss)- This was the catalyst for realizing and acting on philosophy. I think a phrase that most accurately describes this for me is “existential nighlist” or “absurdist”. This is where I generally believe there is no inherent pre-decided meaning to life but that everyone creates their own. I had a long discussion with Rohan about purpose this week and summarized my life's goals to 3 bullets: Leave the biggest mark on the world as possible Help the most people Take it all in (love) For my 12th birthday my dad did something very interesting. He put $1000 dollars into an investing account and said nothing can be withdrawn until I turn 25 (13 years later). Because of this I went super deep into investing and how to make money through the stock market. I gained so much knowledge about investing, business, and public markets through this experience and I still pay very close attention today. Wanting to make an algorithmic machine learning trading bot was my main motivation for learning computer science too which has been an awesome decision and learning.
037	Essay	Personal Growth	Reflective	How have you changed since the 9th grade?	I am an entirely different person. I have learned proper work habits. I have learned more social nuances and how to make friends and relate to a wide variety of people. I have learned CS which really flipped my perspective on the world and the infrastructure that makes everything work. My understanding of the world has really changed. I sort of took everything for granted back then, through learning higher math and sciences and CS and History you realize how much work, thinking, and blood went into every small detail. Looking at Google maps every single line was decided by whoever could kill other people most efficiently. The design of my computer was literally centuries of technological progress culminating in a relatively cheap device that can perform more computations in a day than the entire world in the 1960s. To conclude this section it may best be described as “appreciation through understanding”.
038	Journal	Science and Technology	Reflective	What could you talk about for 20 minutes with excitement?	I’ve been looking forward to this question.

039	Journal	Science and Technology	Reflective	What do you feel like is your biggest impact on the school community?	I think it is my athletic leadership. Being apart of 3 sports and a junior captain for two of them I interact with and lead a lot of people. Ensuring they are improving, motivated, and having a good time. Actually I think my biggest impact might just be as someone who really cares about and promotes AI, crypto, and other future technologies. A decent number of people will just come up to me and ask really random questions in these fields and I love answering and helping them to the best of my knowledge. One quantitative fact about this is that I have been interviewed for three different bi-line articles on tech and politics this year. I think it is super important for communities to understand these technologies and I am proud to help westminster get closer.
040	Journal	Personal Growth	Reflective	What do you do in your free time?	So I have very little free time on weekdays with school and windy hill. Also, I don’t think I have talked about this yet but Windy Hill is a very important part of my day-to-day life. I go there 4 times a week from 5-8 PM everyday (squash season drops that to 2 times a week and tennis is around 3 because of matches). But I spend a lot of time there getting better at tennis and getting physically fit. Also freshmen year doing windy hill really forced me to have good time management which I am thankful for. Back to free-time I usually spend it playing or teaching a racket sport, hanging out with friends, or working on CS tech projects. Currently I am trying to train a connect 4 bot that is computationally efficient (unlike other bots out there) and training it by only playing versions of itself. This is a proof of concept to see if more complex games/scenarios can be beat only ever playing against versions of itself.
041	Essay	Personal Growth	Reflective	What have been your two most meaningful high school classes and why?	APCSA with Mrs. Snyder This class introduced me to the world of CS, got me an internship last summer, and has inspired so much more down the line with my CS experience. This is a good chance to talk about my website landoncummings.com This is where I put cool interactive demos for some of my best work. I have 5 projects highlighted currently and they are the following A MacOS app I built that anyone can download. This app (with proper permissions) accesses all of the user’s imessage data and does high-level content-blind analysis. Outputs cool charts ie most active times of day, activity over last couple years, most active group chats, people you are in contact most, and some cool things for specific contacts or group chats LandonGPT 1 - chatGPT-like model trained to text exactly like me. Used all my texting data from 2023 onwards. Over 350+ messages from people visiting site (entirely westminster kids). Very customizable 2d planetary simulation A page where you can see an AI play the classic Snake game on multiple different maps and how they were trained And a report and model I made in an attempt to predict stock prices and make money with deep machine learning. Go check it out if you are curious about any more of these. Also this is 5/23 ish projects I have done since rising junior summer.   HPIC with rondeau This class was a doozy. Probably the hardest class I’ve ever taken. Lots of confidence gained by doing well in this class. Also, another big thing of this class was where I really caught up and challenged some of my peers who had previously beaten me in all aspects academically throughout middle school and 9th grade. I really felt like I proved to myself and some of my friends that I was at a high level academically. I don’t know my numbers but I’m pretty confident my GPA has increased each year and relatively I think I am gaining ground.
042	Journal	Personal Growth	Reflective	What has been your favorite JanTerm? Why?	Junior year entrepreneurship. With Elby Joel and Sarah Pangle I really enjoyed freshmen yr board games but this takes the cake. I felt like this class prepared me for real life for two big reasons. First, it was about entrepreneurship, which is exactly what I want to do with my life so everything I learned I would utilize in life. Usually with school it is not like I am going to use specific knowledge of classes ie facts about napolean or how the cytosol impacts a cell for my plan in life. Second, this was effectively a public speaking/presentation class. In the very first day we gave 3 presentations of 20 seconds 1 min and 2 min all before lunch. This was excellent for learning to present and think about what to say in a relatively short time.
043	Journal	Personal Growth	Reflective	What college majors or concentrations do you find interesting? Why?	I am very interested in the engineering and CS fields. For CS with a ML, AI focus that would be awesome. My largest concern with this is that I believe that this whole space will be nuked by AI. Especially because I would break onto the scene in 5 years which by then LLM’s and agentic systems will replace 20-50% of all developers. So I would rather have a valuable major which CS does not really qualify as in 5 years. Next for engineering I love Industrial engineering which is basically just optimizing stuff. This is something I love and i'm sure my parents would strongly agree with that. Unfortunately I also have a concern with this field as this knowledge isn’t great for building new things. I need to look further into the other engineering fields. If you asked me right now what I would do in college my answer would be a CS industrial engineering double major.
044	Essay	Science and Technology	Reflective	What is one thing you haven't shared that you would want a college admissions office to know about you and why?	This is a good place to talk about my goal with college and what I want to do with my life In college I want to learn the most valuable knowledge and skills in technology. Most likely not going into education past that. After college I want to (maybe) work for a bit, ultimately wanting to get into building technology businesses or working with early startups. Building new things, technological progress, and business are three things I absolutely love in life so this would be the dream.

047	Article	Personal Growth	Informative	Write your bio for a Pickleball job you are starting.	An Atlanta native, Landon Cummings started playing tennis in elementary school. He went on to play high school tennis for Westminster, where he helped the team win two state championships. He also played varsity squash for the team that won the Division V national championship. A natural leader, he was captain of both the varsity squash and tennis teams. Landon started playing pickleball five years ago and has developed into a high-level player who has competed in the Atlanta Open PPA event. Landon has helped aspiring pickleball players learn the game since he earned his PPR coaching certification last year.  Landon coaches because he loves sharing his passion for racquet sports with others. He believes that the best methodology in coaching is one that intertwines hard work with fun.  Although happiest with a paddle or racquet in his hand, Landon also enjoys playing frisbee, computer science, and hanging out with friends.
048	Essay	Science and Technology	Persuasive	Why do you want to study your chosen major, and why do you want to study that major at Georgia Tech? (300 words or less)	I stared down rows and rows of data on my computer, but this wasn’t just data: it represented endless rows of American crops. Last summer, I enrolled in a machine learning competition to improve my skills. I was surprised when I learned that my work had the potential to benefit farmers. The goal was to engineer a system that determined which fertilizers lead to ideal crop growth in different environments. After the competition ended and I saw the application of the models, I was intrigued to learn that it was industrial engineers who transformed the raw data into models, and those models into real-world solutions.  Industrial Engineering lies exactly where I want to be: at the intersection of people, data, and industry. Georgia Tech courses, such as Stochastic Manufacturing and Service Systems, Simulation Analysis and Design, and Decision and Data Analytics, will enable me to design more effective systems across multiple disciplines. Applying what I learn in ISYE classes, I could optimize a hospital's patient pipeline for better care at Georgia Tech's Center for Health Analytics and Informatics. I could also reorganize the floor plan of a warehouse to reduce carbon emissions at the Supply Chain & Logistics Institute. Through the co-op program, I'll gain industry-relevant experience as a student, and I’ll be exposed to a wide range of projects by tackling logistical inefficiencies with a capstone team. Georgia Tech offers countless optimization challenges for industrial engineers, and the work being done there shows me that optimization isn't just about reducing cost. It's also about creating systems that serve both people and the planet. Georgia Tech provides opportunities for real-world experience, project-based learning, and access to world-class professors. It's a place where I can turn my ideas into action.
049	Essay	Personal Growth	Reflective	The transition from middle to high school is a key time for students as they reach new levels of both academic and personal discovery. Please share a book (novel, non-fiction, etc.) that had a serious impact on you during this time. Please focus more on why this book made an impact on you and less on the plot/theme of the book itself (we are not looking for a book report). 200-300 words	Uglies, by Scott Westerfeld, is a dystopian novel that helped me navigate the social pressures of high school. Uglies depicts a potential future society where, at age 18, everyone is required to undergo surgeries that modify both their appearance and brain chemistry to be perpetually attractive and happy. However, some run away and live natural lives. During my transition to high school, this book impacted me because it highlighted the tension between a life of blissful ignorance and one filled with knowledge. Characters could choose to live flawless lives where they party all day and are always happy, or they could choose to forgo this guaranteed pleasure for lives filled with typical challenges. Uglies forces the reader to consider the line between comfort and authenticity. When I got to high school, I felt like I had to make similar choices. Would I conform and wear Nike shoes like everyone else? Wearing Nikes as opposed to the comfortable Asics I already owned would require me to give up what worked for me in favor of something more trendy. While I did care what other people thought, Uglies taught me to be confident in my choices and not conform simply to fit in. Ultimately, the lessons of Uglies helped me hold strong and embrace my own style regardless of what was popular. Uglies taught me how to make my own individual decisions, even when they set me apart from others around me. Overcoming somewhat trivial challenges, such as being confident in my shoe choice, taught me to believe in myself and my decisions, allowing me to face bigger challenges and confront the world on my own terms.
050	Narrative	Personal Growth	Reflective	Think of all the activities — both in and outside of school — that you have been involved with during high school. Which one are you most proud of and why?	The gate slams shut, and suddenly I’m in a world where racket sports collide. My friends and I call it cage tennis. What began as simply messing around on some forgotten platform tennis courts became a novel sport we can’t stop playing. The setup is simple: a platform tennis court with a steel chain-link fence around it, pickleball paddles, a tennis ball, and some rules we made up. At first, it was chaos. Balls flying off the walls, dubiously defined rules, and shots sailing way out of the cage. As we played, the chaos became our playground. We borrowed rules from Padel to play off the walls, added tennis-like serves, and incorporated the strategy of squash. Before long, our sport didn’t resemble anything we had played before. What I love about cage tennis is how dynamic it is. Every time we play, we experiment with crazy strategies, adjust the rules, and hit shots that couldn’t exist anywhere else. Without a rule book and with no refs, cage tennis is as much about creativity as it is about competition. On top of that, it is something totally unique to my friends and me. Cage tennis is ours to change as we play. Looking back on high school, I am most proud of building something unique and seeing it come alive with people I care about. Most people who play sports stick to the rules, but stepping off the beaten path allowed my friends and me to build a community. The cage is our own domain where we have competition, jokes, laughter, and most importantly, the friends who care enough to show up to play.
051	Essay	Science and Technology	Persuasive	What is your impression of Duke as a university and community, and why do you believe it is a good match for your goals, values, and interests? If there is something specific that attracts you to our academic offerings in Trinity College of Arts and Sciences or the Pratt School of Engineering, or to our co-curricular opportunities, feel free to include that too. (250 word limit).	Engineering reminds me of teleportation. Not the kind that moves objects, but the kind that pushes ideas beyond boundaries and transforms them into something you can see and experience. This type of work isn’t always pretty, though, because prototypes break, code crashes, and designs fail. Failure is how I learn. When I design a new payload for the robotics company where I work, I quickly make a first draft and deploy it to test sites ASAP. Inevitably, it isn’t ideal, but I’d rather try something three times and learn how to make it better than spend a month designing what I imagine to be the perfect, one-shot solution. Pratt’s culture encourages students to dive right in and learn by doing, even if this means they might fail on the first try. When I toured Duke, I saw posters on the windows of the Design POD displaying what freshmen in EGR101L: Engineering Design and Technical Communications created to solve a real-world challenge. One group had been tasked with finding a way to safely transport premature newborns in rural Africa to hospitals despite dangerous road and temperature conditions. I was awe-struck at how first-year students could have such a meaningful impact. I plan on majoring in Mechanical Engineering at Pratt because it is a place where I can take ideas from the theoretical to the physical. At Duke, I will fail without fear while collaborating with a dynamic community of students who are determined to make a positive impact on the world.

My friends and I call it cage tennis.  What began this past summer as simply messing around on some forgotten platform tennis courts became a game we can’t stop playing. The setup is simple: a platform tennis court with a steel mesh cage around it, pickleball paddles, a tennis ball, and some rules we made up. At first, it was chaos with balls ricocheting off the walls, dubiously defined rules, and shots sailing way out of the cage. As we played, the chaos became our playground. We borrowed rules from Padel to play off the walls, added tennis-like serves, and took strategy from squash. Before long, our sport didn’t resemble anything we had played before.  Cage tennis is exciting because of how dynamic it is. Every time we play, we experiment with crazy strategies, adjust the rules, and hit shots that couldn’t exist anywhere else. Without a rule book and with no refs, cage tennis is as much about creativity as it is about competition.  In the end, it's not the changing rules that keep me coming back multiple times a week, it’s the people. The laughter, the inside jokes, and the bragging rights the next day at school make the cage feel like an exciting second home.

It was a simple neural network trained to play the game of Pong. It blew my mind that the computer wasn’t just following rules, it actually learned through trial and error. I’ve spent the past three years building and deploying dozens of AIs for various applications, from browser automation to email assistants. I want to continue mastering the art of AI at MIT. The MIT culture of failing fast and often is appealing. Just like an AI, I believe humans learn best from failing, iterating, and trying again.

These grading discrepancies made me question how the process could be improved, so I decided to explore outside my school’s curriculum. This year, I applied for an Independent Study, completing a project proposal and a ten-page literature review under a faculty mentor. My goal was to investigate whether LLMs could grade essays more objectively than humans. This required them to be unbiased, which I assumed they were. My early results were unexpected.

I’ve had LLMs grade over 250,000 essays, and the results are statistically significant and replicated across three of the leading AI labs: OpenAI, Google, and xAI. While adopting name-blind grading would solve this variance, it is representative of a bias inherent to LLMs. In November, I will present my findings to over 100 students, faculty, parents, and alumni. Independent Study has allowed me to step off the well-trodden path and explore the pros and cons of advanced technologies and shine a light on a little-known, yet problematic, facet of LLMs. As long as LLMs exhibit biases, we as a society must identify and eliminate them before we entrust LLMs with high-stakes decisions.

In my work for Fully Furnished Ministries, I collaborate with volunteers from all over Atlanta. Together, we pick up furniture from donors and deliver refurbished furniture to those in need. We mostly support families transitioning out of homelessness, domestic abuse victims, and people recovering from other crises. In the past year, my mom and I have dedicated over 20 hours to serving this organization.  The connections we’ve formed with fellow volunteers and the families we serve have been meaningful. We have worked alongside friends, a local football team, and a past beneficiary of Fully Furnished Ministries named Kay. When we volunteered together this summer, Kay shared that two years ago, she was a furniture recipient. She told me how much it meant for her kids to move from sleeping on mattresses on the floor to their own beds and the dignity they felt eating at their own table. She promised herself that once she was able, she would give back to the organization that had helped her family. We were both tired and drenched in sweat when she told me this story at our last delivery spot of the day, but it reminded me why I serve and the positive impact a nonprofit like Fully Furnished Ministries can have when the community collaborates to improve lives.
056	Narrative	Personal Growth	Reflective	How did you manage a situation or challenge that you didn’t expect? What did you learn from it? 225 words.	When I became captain of the squash team, I expected everyone to match the intensity I brought to the team workouts. This was not the case. There was a group that simply went through the motions and didn’t commit to improving off the court.  At first, I became more strict. I would choose brutal workouts and call out teammates for not trying. This did not work. In fact, I think kids dreaded working out more while also becoming annoyed with me. At this point, I realized I was doing it wrong, but I didn’t know how to do it right.  Walking out of a particularly enjoyable biology class, it hit me that squash workouts lacked individual ownership. Biology was fun because it wasn’t just students sitting around listening to a predictable lecture. Questions were presented to the class, people were called on randomly, and everyone felt recognized because they had some influence over how the class flowed.  I sat down with our head coach and the other captain, and we mapped out how workouts would run going forward. In just a week, things changed. Workouts now always involve a team aspect, whether it’s a group sprint chasing an average time or a core workout where each person leads an exercise. Engagement skyrocketed. I learned that leadership isn’t about mandating effort, but motivating through individual ownership.

I am fascinated by systems that can beat humans or make humans better. Here are the ones I am most proud of:  I built and published an iPhone app called Poker Pilot Pro that simulates thousands of poker games to precisely estimate the odds of a hand winning before and after the flop. I built (unfortunately can’t publish this one) a macOS app that goes into a computer's iMessages and analyzes data on everything from most active times, most corresponded-with contacts, and group chat breakdowns. I fine-tuned a large language model on my own texting data so that the model texted like me (and tested whether it passed the Turing test on my friends). I trained AIs to play/beat the following games: 2048, Pong, Connect 4, Flappy Bird, Snake, Brawl Stars, and Clash Royale. I programmed and published a Chrome extension called Browser Boss that could control your browser given simple text input using large language models.

059	Essay	Society and Culture	Persuasive	Write a college level essay on Jane Eyre.	“Colonizer’s Paradise” Colonial Courtship in Jane Eyre Victorian England was a period characterized by great technological, artistic, and societal advancements. Behind these great accomplishments lies the darker side of the Empire: colonialism. England colonized over 120 unique territories, impacting the lives of more than a billion people. Interestingly, the zealous colonialism of England is reflected in the behavior of its population, particularly the men. The colonial efforts usually consist of three distinct facets: justification, claim, and exploitation. Colonist-like behavior is seen in Jane Eyre, a novel about a woman searching and fighting for independence and agency in the Victorian Era. In Jane Eyre, Charlotte Brontë develops the recurring motif of a metaphorical colonization of women, specifically during marriage proposal scenes, to draw attention to a hazardous pattern of behaviors exhibited by some Victorian men. St. John convincing Jane to marry him is analogous to how England colonized in the 1800s, specifically the patterns in action and speech. First, when St. John tries to secure Jane’s hand in marriage, he justifies his conquest with God: “God and nature intended you for a missionary’s wife. It is not personal, but mental endowments they have given you” (359). St. John attributes his pursuit of Jane’s hand to something God intended. The methodology of justifying an action with God’s will is strikingly similar to how colonizers from Brontë’s time period justified colonizing territories, specifically with manifest destiny. Colonizers often defended colonialism by arguing that it was their divine God-given right to take new territories and control native populations. Richard Hakluyt, an English colonist, titles his principal chapter in his letter to Queen Elizabeth I asking for funding to colonize the Americas: “That this western discoverie will be greatly for the enlargement of the gospel of Christ whereunto the Princes of the reformed religion are chiefly bound amongst whom her Majestie is principally” (Hakluyt). In his chapter, Richard Hakluyt argues it is England’s moral duty to colonize and convert territories to Christianity, similar to how St. John justified his proposal of marriage to Jane as something “God and nature intended”. Second, St. John claims Jane as his territory. When St. John tries to force Jane into marriage, he confidently states “You Shall be mine: I claim you-not for my pleasure, but for my Sovereign’s service” (359). St. John goes so far as to claim Jane, just as a country might claim a new land. His particular use of the phrase “Sovereign’s service” draws even more parallels to English colonialism. St. John wants to be this “Sovereign”, exercising complete control of Jane, similar to how the English Empire presided over their colonies. While St. John is vying for Jane’s hand, Jane wrestles with his proposal internally. Jane realizes that St. John fails to see her humanity: “He prizes me as a soldier would a good weapon; and that is all” (361). Just as the English might see a new colony as a source of wealth, St. John only sees Jane as a useful device to aid him in his colonial endeavors. Ironically, while St. John metaphorically tries to colonize Jane, his effort is only a stepping stone to colonize all of India. St. John dehumanizes Jane by attempting to exploit her as a mere tool, similar to how a colony would dehumanize and exploit the native populations. Brontë reveals much about men’s behavior, both towards women and towards colonialism, during the Victorian era. St. John isn’t the only man who tries to metaphorically colonize Jane. Mr. Rochester also engages in colonial behavior in his attempt to marry Jane. Just like St. John, Mr. Rochester enacts the same three-pronged colonialist approach in his effort to marry Jane: Mr. Rochester justifies why he should be the one to marry her, claims ownership, and then exploits and demeans her. Unlike St. John and his justification through God, Mr. Rochester justifies his match to Jane with his extreme love and emotional dependence. Immediately after Mr. Rochester reveals that his supposed marriage to Ingram was all a plot to make Jane jealous, he proposes dramatically: “You-you strange-you almost unearthly thing!-I love as my own flesh. You-poor and obscure, and small and plain as you are-I entreat to accept me as a husband” (229). Mr. Rochester confirms that he wishes to marry Jane because of his intense love for her, proclaiming that he loves her as much as he “love[s] [his] own flesh”. Mr. Rochester justifies the metaphorical colonization he attempts with his burning love. At the same time, he also defines a clear power dynamic. Mr. Rochester, the already dominant figure, describes Jane in many demeaning ways such as “poor and obscure” along with “small and plain”. Brontë employs such diction to provide a window into the stark contrast in power between Mr. Rochester and Jane and to illustrate Mr. Rochester’s eagerness to dominate, comparable to a vast Empire and a single fledgling colony. Unsurprisingly, Mr. Rochester has been claiming Jane as his own for a while now. Over a month before the proposal, right after he steps out of his Gypsy costume, he boldly states “My little friend! … I wish I were in a quiet island with only you” (184). Mr. Rochester deems Jane his “little friend”, implying a personal claim to her. Similar to how an Empire may claim control of a territory when they win their hand through diplomacy or force, Mr. Rochester already starts claiming Jane’s future. Furthermore, he defies their professionally defined employer-employee relationship. Finally, Mr. Rochester establishes and enforces his dominance over Jane. When Jane declines Mr. Rochester’s invitation to dinner, he aggressively retorts “Once I have fairly seized you, to have and to hold, I’ll just-figuratively speaking-attach you to a chain like this. Yes, bonny wee thing. I’ll wear you in my bosom, lest my jewel I should tyne” (243). Soon after their proposal, Mr. Rochester is already eager to establish the hierarchical nature of their relationship. Just as the English Empire enslaved native peoples and put them in chains, Mr. Rochester passionately states he would “figuratively… attach [Jane] to a chain.” Brontë illustrates the similarity to colonial slavery with a powerful metaphor, comparing Jane to a chained jewel. For the English Empire, captivity and complete control led to stability and profit; however, for Mr. Rochester, capturing and securing Jane means complete dominance, satisfying his emotional dependence and fervent love. Moreover, Mr. Rochester objectifies Jane, comparing her to a jewel he would attach to his bosom, just as England would objectify and dehumanize the native peoples to further exploit and profit. Ultimately, Charlotte Brontë highlights the pattern where those in power exploit marginalized groups in the same manner the British Empire treated colonies. St. John and Mr. Rochester’s relationship with Jane is not just some plot devices, but together a complex motif representing the exploitation and suppression innate to colonial behavior. In doing so, Brontë illustrates the perilous nature of colonial behavior towards marginalized groups; simultaneously, Brontë empowers those under colonial siege to stand up for themselves and resist oppression in the same way Jane resisted Mr. Rochester and St. John. In today’s society, Brontë’s lessons still ring true. One such example is the emotionally burdensome relationship where one partner exploits another financially or emotionally. Brontë’s Jane Eyre maintains its relevance over a century later, due to the enduring need to resist oppression and champion equality.
060	Narrative	Personal Growth	Reflective	Tell me about an object in your life that has a lot of hidden significance.	I walk into my closet and there it is, right at eye level. A small white cardboard box with packing tape still around it. That box brings me back. Back when I forgot who I was. Although it was about five years ago, I remember almost nothing from both that year or my life before. Looking back on that time period one thing stands out: an ultra-complex Japanese card game. It is something called Yu-Gi-Oh. When I became detached from many aspects of my old life, online Yu-Gi-Oh was all I had. I would practice, test, and compete for hours on end each day in order to become better and better at Yu-Gi-Oh. I spent days on end perfecting lines of play, memorizing points of failures of other meta decks, and testing every minute change to a deck imaginable. I joined a clan and was on the starting team for a very competitive group. Three times random internet strangers paid for my entrance into a cash tournament to play on their behalf. This white box in my closet is all that I have left from this time period. It is the second place prize for a 128 man tournament I played in from 2020. Covid was a period of great change in my life. As soon as school got canceled, my family and I moved to Florida. Little did I know I would be there for nine months. During that entire time, I would not see a single person my age. My family made the choice to stay virtual when everyone went back in person, consequently, I was the one kid teachers had to open zoom for and I watched all my classes alone through a computer screen. Without a phone, this watching of class was the only social interaction I had. All of the friendships I had to that point were effectively hemorrhaged. When I did eventually return, I was lost socially. The one thing I knew better than anyone was Yu-Gi-Oh, and I used my same strategy of getting better at a card game to re-integrate into the class of 2026. In many ways, this process has never ended. I still test different ways of saying the same thing and increase or decrease certain aspects of my personality around different groups (ie weighing humor more heavily in a group of boys or bringing up more academic subjects in front of more academic people). Just nowadays it doesn’t feel like I am using Yu-Gi-Oh strategy for my social life, and I now know this social fine tuning is something all people use either consciously or subconsciously. Looking back on my life now, that box is symbolic of both my experience during covid, and how I built who I was after covid.
061	Essay	Personal Growth	Reflective	Write a thoughtful essay on your philosophy on life.	When I was twelve, I asked myself: What’s the point of life? I had no answer. Was it to be famous—maybe have a Wikipedia page? Was it to be a good follower of your faith? To make the most money? To be happy? I wasn’t sure. I’m still not. Years later, I encountered a crazy idea. What if there is no pre-defined purpose? What if meaning isn’t discovered, but chosen? I’ve since adopted a philosophy that can help to answer these existential questions: optimistic nihilism. It suggests that life has no inherent meaning. There is no predetermined script that we are meant to follow. But instead of retreating into despair, this blank slate offers freedom and opportunity. If nothing is assigned, then anything is possible. This possibility enthralls me. This allows me to choose my own values based on what I care about. I don’t wait for a sign from the universe or follow a defined path. I make my meaning and define my values through action—whether that’s encouraging underclassmen to give 110% during a workout, diving into a machine learning rabbit hole, or running experiments with friends to find the fastest routes between two school buildings. From impact to curiosity to optimization to empathy, I define and discover meaning in the moments where I push boundaries and help others do the same. This mindset crystallized after the passing of my great-grandfather, my first major loss of a loved one. My great-grandfather lived a full life, but still disappeared in a flash. It struck me that everything he’d lived—every relationship, emotion, and achievement—was gone. This shook me. Seeing how fickle life is cemented this philosophy. If nothing lasts forever, then every action today matters more than ever before. I live with urgency and intensity. Every second counts—you only get so many, and they pass in a flash. Whether I’m diving into a new AI project, chasing down a tennis ball like my life depends on it, or getting way too competitive over a board game with friends, I go all-in. I don’t relax in the traditional sense. Sitting around doing nothing has never been my thing. I recharge by getting curious, joking around with close friends, or testing my own limits. Living life to the fullest doesn’t mean chasing constant excitement. For me it means being intentional, focused, and really showing up for whatever I’m doing. If I commit to something, I’m giving it everything I’ve got. So, how does this impact my future? I have three larger goals in life that I aim to achieve. First, I want to take it all in. I want to appreciate every moment I have and love the world around me. This doesn’t just consist of the highs in life. This means enjoying the grind and finding the bright spots through pain. Second, I want to improve the world. I want to help as many people as possible in a meaningful way. From volunteering in my local community, I’ve seen how small things matter. Like connecting with a Colombian family through Spanish at a food bank. Helping them feel seen and making sure they leave with enough food isn’t world-changing on its own, but in that moment, it means everything. Those are the moments I want to multiply and deliver at scale, all over the world. Third, I want to leave a mark. I want to look back at the world on my deathbed and see the effect of my life. I imagine a purpose to my life. I want to look back and see this not as an imagination or dream, but as a reality. I may never have a concrete answer to the question I asked at twelve. But that’s the beauty of it. Life’s meaning isn’t something you find—it’s something you define for yourself.

If this sounds like you, then please share your story.	The whiteboard was crammed with arrows, parameters, and computer environments, all stacked on top of each other like a Jenga tower about to topple. The computer read 2:08 AM, and I was four hours into debugging an AI to play one of my favorite childhood games: Connect 4. Even though my laptop battery was dying, I felt energized. The intensity of that 2:08 AM moment reflects how I approach the world. In everyday situations, from social interactions to engineering, I treat each challenge as an opportunity to observe, test, and improve. I first recognized this mindset on my 13th birthday when my parents placed $100 in an investment account and told me it was mine to manage. The thrill wasn’t in the money but in understanding the systems behind financial markets. How did they work? How could investing be optimized? At first, Google Sheets was my go-to, but when I discovered machine learning, it made Sheets feel like a stone-age tool. I pivoted my focus from trying to outguess the market to understanding the technology that could. A few years later, I took AP Computer Science, where I finally learned how to code. Coding enabled me to bring my ideas to life. My first application was to build a system that was strong enough to beat me at an online game called Clash. Clash with friends was fun, but I wanted to understand its mechanics and patterns. After two weeks of work, it happened… I lost. Then my friends lost too. Our group chat turned into nonstop bot debates and bot smack talk that still continues today. This moment was the catalyst. I realized I want to build systems at the bleeding edge of what's possible and bring people together.  I learned that not all systems are as straightforward when COVID pulled my family into isolation in Florida for over a year. My social life shrank to Zoom school and pickleball with shockingly athletic retirees. As a high-risk family, we skipped the fall return to school, and by spring, I came back feeling like I didn’t know how to talk to people my own age anymore. Eventually, I began treating my social life like a system: observing, tweaking, and testing. I studied what created connection, how conversation flowed, and why groups formed. Painstakingly, I rebuilt my social life. Two years later, I had graduated from relying on mimicry to fit in and was growing into my authentic self. My systems mindset was evident this past summer during an internship at Undaunted, a tech startup that builds robotic dogs to secure housing units in high-crime areas. My project was to engineer a system to keep the dogs online despite frequent overheating errors in the sweltering temperatures. Three weeks in, a heat wave hit, and more than ten robots went offline in a single day. That week, I led the team in an urgent deployment of anti-overheat systems to all robot dogs across Atlanta. Late one night, after we had successfully finished the rollout, we all sat on a curb and reflected on the hectic week: all the hours spent, the racing around Atlanta, and the tsunami of sweat we poured out. Throughout this crisis, I sacrificed family, social, and sports commitments, but I wouldn’t trade that experience for anything. It wasn’t just about keeping the machines running; it was about protecting the system that communities relied upon. For the first time, my systems thinking had moved beyond simple games into serious, real-world applications. I want to continue scaling this perspective by impacting people’s everyday lives. Whether it is detecting diseases early or democratizing education, there are infinite possibilities for leveraging my systems mindset to create a better world. It all started because I wanted to beat the stock market. Somewhere along the way, I fell in love with optimizing everything else.
063	Academic	Science and Technology	Informative	Write a literature review about the idea of LLMs as essay graders in school.	Leveraging Large Language Models for More Objective Grading of Essays and Writing In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have rapidly advanced, demonstrating the ability to produce high-quality, human-like text and perform advanced reasoning. Pioneered by OpenAI, this novel architecture has already begun to reshape large industries such as healthcare, legal work, and computer science. Education, particularly automated grading, stands out as a promising yet controversial application of LLMs. Human grading has long been criticized for inconsistency and bias. Research has shown that trivial factors, such as the time of day essays are graded, the order in which essays are graded, and perceived identity of students, can significantly impact the grading process. This creates an opportunity for LLMs to be utilized to achieve fairer grading in schools. Yet a crucial question remains: to what extent can LLMs mitigate these weaknesses and to what extent do they replicate the same pitfalls as humans. Minimizing and ultimately eliminating subjectivity in grading is crucial. Grades influence future opportunities, from college admissions to career prospects. When arbitrary factors and implicit biases weigh on the grading scale, the metric meant to determine skill becomes unreliable. Instead of serving as a dependable system of measurement of knowledge and skill, grades risk reflecting conditions under which they were read and the biases of the graders. This could cause equally skilled students to receive unfair advantages or disadvantages. In the worst case, entire segments of the population could experience widespread educational disadvantages due to grader biases. This literature review will explore five core areas: (1) inconsistencies and bias in human grading, (2) methods teachers use to promote fair grading, (3) the intelligence and architecture of LLMs, (4) biases and inconsistencies within LLMs, (5) applications of LLMs to grading. This literature review investigates whether LLMs can provide more objective essay evaluation than human graders by exploring the topics of human bias, capabilities of LLMs, their limitations, and more. Inconsistencies and Bias in Human Grading Human grading is far from objective. There are many seemingly random ways in which essays can be unfairly graded. One such mechanism is sequential bias. A 30-million-essay analysis revealed that essays graded later in a session were assigned scores 0.2 standard deviations (approximately 3.5 points) lower than those graded earlier. This trend demonstrates the grader fatigue that humans face. Additionally, the alphabetical grading systems that most universities use lead to consistently worse performance from those with surnames in the back of the alphabet. Such arbitrary sequencing can meaningfully impact scores and course GPA. This inconsistency results from grader fatigue and impatience, illustrating how random factors such as timing and order can distort grading outcomes from something other than just the raw quality of work. Another way in which grading becomes subjective is when biases are present. Whether implicit or explicit, every human has biases of some kind. Even among four-year-old kids, there are implicit biases related to race and gender (Perszyk, Lei, Bodenhausen, Richeson, & Waxman, 2019). The presence of bias at the young age of four suggests how any later attempts to eliminate bias may just be addressing the symptoms of the issue as opposed to tackling the root cause. There is also bias in adult graders. One particular study found that when grading, adults do not have a constant magnitude of bias and the context of the work can amplify or suppress bias. Doyle, Harris, and Easterbrook (2024) found that under higher grading pressure, evaluators expressed more bias towards certain demographic and socioeconomic groups. This dynamic creates an unfair playing field where students graded in high-pressure environments are systematically exposed to more unfair grading. A final study on racial bias analyzed how teachers graded essays when the only variable that changed between them was the students name. Essays with stereotypically white names received higher grades than essays with stereotypically black names (Quinn, 2020). All these studies on racial bias reveal how perceived race, gender, or socioeconomic background can bias teachers into unfairly advantaging or disadvantaging certain groups of people. Unbeknownst to the evaluator or student, a grade may depend on identity rather than pure essay quality. Because these inconsistencies are so pervasive, teachers and researchers have developed structured methods to reduce the subjectivity of the grading process. These methods and processes are the foundation of ensuring fairness and will be discussed in the following section. Methods Teachers Use to Promote Fair Grading  Educators have developed structured methods to reduce bias, even if subjectivity cannot be completely eliminated. One such tool is rubrics and standards-based grading (SBG). These are usually well defined rules to determine the score of an essay. While Mechtenberg (2024) found that SBGs eliminated numeric racial bias, the persistence of bias in the feedback and commentary underscore the challenge of completely removing implicit bias from qualitative evaluations. In another study with German teachers grading works with Turkish or German sounding students, Peter, Karst, and Bonefeld (2024) showed that bias was present in grading yet it disappeared when teachers were given an error table (similar to a rubric or SBG). These two studies show that bias can be reduced with structured grading systems, yet the qualitative feedback systems still contain implicit biases. This suggests that while structured systems may constrain numerical outcomes, bias is not entirely eliminated as it leaks into the feedback systems.  Another common approach is blind grading, where a student’s identity is hidden from the grader. In 2010, Stockholm University went from their traditional grading system to a blind system. Hinnerich, Höglin, and Johannesson (2015) measured the bias of graders against Swedish and non-Swedish students before and after the switch. They found that after implementing blind grading, the 6% higher pass rate that non-Swedish students experienced prior to 2010 largely disappeared. Tools such as blind grading and strict evaluation frameworks have shown that while human subjectivity cannot be eliminated, they can help to reduce the amount of bias expressed in grading.  In large courses, grading is often done by multiple teachers assistants, creating inconsistency depending on who evaluates the work. Notably, there has been research done in this field with multi-grader systems and the results are promising. Kates, Paulsen, Yntiso, and Tucker (2023) found that with an assignment graded by multiple graders, employing a special scaling model reduced grader variance by more than 50% while requiring minimal additional effort. This essentially adds a safety net pulling in outlier graders and reducing the inconsistency introduced by someone too harsh or too lenient. Multi-grader systems, blind grading, and well defined systems for grading all enable humans to reduce their bias when grading schoolwork. Despite this, no catch-all solution exists, potentially suggesting that human bias is impossible to truly separate from any grading system. Given these persistent limitations, exploring LLMs as a potential alternative or assistant to human graders requires a deep understanding of their capabilities and underlying architecture. The Intelligence and Architecture of LLMs  Large Language Models (LLMs) have taken the world by storm, garnering attention for their apparent reasoning and language skills. OpenAI’s ChatGPT alone attracts over 800 million weekly users. This surge in popularity has fueled a large academic interest in whether these LLMs actually possess “intelligence”. Munnerley, Rajaram, Munnerley, and Chau (2024), evaluated over 500 LLMs on 12 tests. They tested the reasoning, reading/writing, domain-specific knowledge, and quantitative knowledge of LLMs. The findings showed that performance on one test was correlated with performance on other tests. This suggests that there is some underlying capability present in LLMs challenging the idea that these models are only good at narrow tasks they are trained for. Although there was no clear conclusion on if the ability of the LLMs was caused by human-like intelligence or advanced pattern-matching. This uncertainty is important to note as it complicates how we interpret LLM based grading and whether it is true reasoning and logic, or simply skilled pattern-matching. Moving from academic capabilities to emotional capabilities, Schlegel, Sommer, and Mortillaro (2025) took 4 of the leading LLMs at the time and tested them on emotional intelligence. Humans average 56% on these tests while LLMs are able to score 82%. This suggests that LLMs have a very impressive ability to understand human emotions and human interactions. High emotional intelligence is a great sign for LLM grading as it confirms that these models are capable of correctly interpreting and understanding emotions at a very high level. Although impressive, these studies don’t conclude whether LLMs possess human-like intelligence or high-level pattern-matching. If LLMs rely on pattern-matching instead of general reasoning that means their evaluations may seem logical but lack depth when encountering novel ideas. Regardless, these abilities are only possible due to the underlying architecture of LLMs, particularly the transformer and attention mechanisms.  LLMs are able to achieve high marks on human tasks through many advances in the architecture of text-predicting models. LLMs generate text based on something called a token. A token is usually a word or piece of a word but can also be punctuation, numbers, or any typable symbol. LLMs work by predicting the next token in a sequence. Given the sequence of tokens “my goldfish swims around in its” an LLM predicts the next word. In this case, an LLM would likely predict the token “bowl” to follow this sentence. To generate large outputs and lots of text, an LLM simply runs many times, appending more and more words to the sequence of tokens until it decides to stop. Looking at the actual architecture of these models, transformers and attention heads are what make this all possible. First introduced in 2017 by Google, Vaswani et al. released the legendary “Attention Is All You Need” paper. This lays the groundwork for modern LLMs. Prior neural network approaches to text generation still predicted one token at a time, but they processed sequences in a more limited sequential manner. What transformers and attention introduce is a way for tokens to relate and contextualize other tokens enabling a more powerful and efficient model. To illustrate this concept simply, consider the sentence “the mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell”. With attention, a model can weigh how much each token relates to one another. Here, to correctly interpret the meaning of “cell” the models consider the relation to “mitochondria” and “powerhouse” enabling it to infer that a cell relates to the biological cell instead of a prison cell. This skill of dynamically integrating context across tokens is the core of attention-based transformer models. Because transformers and attention are able to capture context across long sequences, they are equipped to evaluate complex student arguments in essays. While this architecture allows LLMs to perform well on many human tasks, they are heavily reliant on massive data and probabilistic outputs leading to LLMs potentially reproducing human biases and inconsistent outputs. Biases and Inconsistencies Within LLMs  With how widespread LLMs have become, it is more imperative than ever to understand some of their limitations. Researchers at Microsoft had LLMs grade over 560,000 summaries written by both humans and other LLMs, they found four forms of bias or inconsistencies when LLMs act as graders (Stureborg et al., 2024). First, they found the models exhibited familiarity bias. This occurred where LLMs preferred writing in a more probabilistic style rather than originality. Second, LLMs had scoring bias. This is where they scored summaries with more round numbers. For example, a model would be more likely to grade something as a 95 compared to a 94 or 96. Third, models exhibited anchoring bias. When tasked with grading 5 aspects of a summary, the score of the first segment that the model graded influenced its grade for the other 4 segments in ways unrelated to actual quality. While anchoring bias exists for humans, it does not manifest itself in the same way as LLMs. This highlights how the underlying token-prediction mechanism may introduce novel biases. Finally, these researchers noted that LLMs were highly sensitive to prompt changes with minor changes sometimes leading to substantial differences in score. Without specific mitigation strategies, LLMs risk replicating common human biases, raising questions about their use in high-stakes assessments.  On top of statistical and cognitive biases mentioned in the previous paragraph, LLMs can also exhibit socially driven biases. Yang, Raković, Gašević, and Chen (2025) studied an advanced LLM and found it was able to infer gender and first-language status from a large database of essays. This is a potential reason for alarm because if they can infer demographic attributes then it is also possible for them to demonstrate bias against groups solely based on the LLM’s demographic assumptions. When LLMs grade these essays with their guess of gender, they express little to no bias. On the other hand, when the LLM could accurately infer the first-language status of an author it did grade with a bias towards native english speakers. Whether this is a true bias against this group of people or simply the familiarity bias mentioned in the previous paragraph is still unknown. Applications of LLMs to Grading Some recent work has explicitly applied LLMs to grading and measured how they compare to humans. In a 2025 study,  Mendonça, Quintal, and Mendonça measure the variance between a group of LLMs and a group of humans. They found that LLMs produce less variance than humans. This is an important finding as it indicates that one LLM or an ensemble of LLMs could offer more consistent grading than a single human. Furthermore, the scores between the LLM group and human group were highly correlated, confirming that LLMs are able to give evaluations that align with humans. Despite this study, the topic of human variability in grading compared to variability of LLMs is a topic that is not well understood, revealing an important gap in academic studies. While discussing whether a human or LLM can grade better is valuable and interesting, there is also a third option that could make the most sense: humans and LLMs. Chen, Singh, and Xie (2025) studied just this. In their study they had an LLM use a strict rubric and generate feedback followed by a human finalizing a grade. The results showed that humans assisted by LLMs had reduced variance between different graders compared to humans not assisted by LLMs. Furthermore, grading efficiency significantly increased when assisted by a model. The LLM suggested score was very similar to the human score in most cases, except when the evaluator stepped in and adjusted scores when context dependent or nuanced ideas were present and went unnoticed by the LLM. These studies demonstrate that models can play many roles in assessment, from independent graders to effective human assistants. There is a growing body of research that suggests that it isn’t a matter of are LLMs useful in grading, but how can LLMs be incorporated into the classroom to free up teachers and provide more objective assessment. Proposed Study Plan  While the findings in this review show that LLMs hold promise, it is clear that at this time, both humans and LLMs fall short of objective grading. This project will attempt to achieve the least amount of subjectivity or bias possible. The study can be broken down into four digestible steps: (1) data collection, (2) LLM comparison, (3) model improvements, and (4) deployment. The first step will be creating a measurable baseline of variance and bias in a dataset of student essays. Second, once a human baseline is established, it will test LLMs and find their variance and test for implicit bias. Third, this study will attempt to improve the model minimizing variance and bias if present. Some methods to experiment with are whether adding another transformer block or fine-tuning an LLM is a feasible and effective solution. Finally, once a best method to minimize variance and bias is found, a public website will be created so that any teacher can augment or automate their grading process. Overall, this project has huge real world applications and can be very beneficial to both students and teachers if executed properly.
064	Essay	Society and Culture	Reflective	The documents above have given you a window into the postbellum economic, political, social and even psychological experiences of the De Rossets and white Southerners like them. Is there a danger for us as historians that such accounts of the postbellum sufferings of white Southerners, seen through their own eyes, may lead us to excuse their actions during Reconstruction? How should historians attempting to understand Reconstruction use the white Southern perspective on the postbellum world?	There is a danger to only using stories from a single point of view, yet approaching events from all sides is imperative to a proper understanding. In a scenario where a historian only viewed postbellum through the lens of the white southerner that would be a dangerous position to believe. On the other hand, while most white southerners were racist and had likely committed hate crimes by today's standards, it is also important to take in their side of the story. These people’s entire world existed with racism and a rigid social hierarchy that re-enforced all these things we now understand to be bad. While these people were complacent in this, we must also recognize that the vast majority of people born into their situation would have behaved very similarly to them. Therefore, while still terrible actions by today’s standards, it is only fair to understand not just the point of view that is accepted as correct today, but the point of view of people who lived in that time period. To clarify, understanding point of views does not endorse them by any means. Furthermore, it is highly likely that today’s perception of what is right and wrong will change in one hundred years and our ideas about what should and shouldn’t be studied could change, therefore understanding all sides to evaluate it in the context of our world today is a necessary and proper aspect to good historianship.
065	Essay	Society and Culture	Persuasive	Write an essay about The Things They Carry by Tim O'Brien.	Stories Can Save Us  Of the 2.7 million American servicemen who served in Vietnam, a study found that nearly 65% of veterans have experienced or still experience mental health challenges such as depression, anxiety, PTSD, and other conditions. Tim O’Brien highlights the brutality and psychological toll of the war, along with the power of stories in his novel The Things They Carried. Storytelling organizes mental chaos, allowing for control over trauma.  O’Brien doesn’t only reshape stories and facts to emphasize the emotions he felt; he also uses his imagination to seize control over moments when he felt powerless. When he kills a soldier, he dreams up a backstory and personality: “He liked books. He wanted someday to be a teacher” (119). O’Brien creates information about this man in order to control the dead man’s legacy, and by association, his legacy. O’Brien felt incredibly guilty and helpless about the man’s meaningless death. His response to his feeling of helplessness is controlling the narrative that we read, going as far as to dream up a full multi-page backstory for the man that lies dead on the trail. Later on in the novel, Kiowa’s death is seen through both Jimmy Cross and O’Brien’s eyes. By creating Jimmy Cross’s perspective, he acts as if he knew what was going on in this traumatic moment. By reshaping painful memories, O’Brien transforms experiences of helplessness into ones he commands. His perspective changes from that of a powerless bystander to that of an almighty creator. In the last story of the book where Linda dies, O’Brien writes, “I concentrated. I willed her alive” (225). Not only does he take control of another painful event, but he also resists her death entirely. By bringing her to life through a story, he preserves his love and memory of Linda in readers, while controlling a painful moment. Storytelling intertwined with O’Brien’s imagination lets him hit back at trauma and take charge of what he couldn't in his past.  Telling a story packages an event and allows others to share an understanding and the trauma attached. Words can’t always encompass all that happens both externally and internally. To tell a story, one must convert it from a chaotic mental form into ordered language for others to interpret. Through this sharing of events, others may come to understand the emotional weight of experiences that would otherwise remain private. After Curt Lemon dies, Rat Kiley takes out his grief on a water buffalo, “He shot it twice in the flanks. It wasn’t to kill; it was to hurt” (75). The brutal scene shocks readers who have become numb to human death, letting them fully grasp the loss and pain that both Kiley and O’Brien feel. Kiley also uses storytelling to dissipate trauma when he writes to Lemon’s sister. While he writes to commemorate Lemon’s life and to offer condolence to a suffering family, it also serves as a way for others to understand and sympathize with Kiley’s grief. Norman Bowker provides a foil to therapeutic storytelling. While driving around the lake, Bowker thinks, “There was nothing to say. He could not talk about it and never would” (147). A constant burden weighs on Bowker. His inability to talk about his trauma means he is unable to share the burden with others. He can’t share his trauma and consequently it eats him alive. If Bowker had opened up about his experiences and pains, others could have sympathized with him and his unique experience could have been appreciated, potentially relieving some of his burden.  O’Brien highlights how stories can save us. By taking a jumbled mental memory of an event and wrestling it into a coherent string of words, it moves from a mental experience to a community experience where others can understand, respect, and help carry the burden of trauma. Retelling a story also permits the teller to inject their imagination into a past event, allowing for control over a moment where they once felt paralyzed by guilt and grief. By sharing stories with others and taking control over painful moments, storytelling acts as a powerful, accessible, and destigmatized form of therapy. Without this help, some veterans may inevitably face the isolation that gripped Norman Bowker, ultimately leading to his suicide. In fact, veteran suicide rates are nearly twice that of the general population, reflecting the toll that trauma can take if left unchecked. As a society, we should listen to veterans’ stories, not simply out of honor, but to help them make peace with their past.
066	Narrative	Personal Growth	Reflective	Write about an object that means a lot to you	First designed and printed into existence in mid June, this piece and all of its derivative works travel miles every single day all across Atlanta.  It all started out of a necessity: keep the robots online. In the Atlanta heat many robotic dogs were going offline due to motor overheating errors. But I’m getting carried away. Let me take a step back real quick. It’s the second week of my summer internship and I’m working at a tiny company named Undaunted. When I joined, it was a mere two employees. Undaunted provides robotic security to construction sites and Class C housing units that can’t afford 24/7 security guards. Instead of paying the 200K or more for a security guard to always be onsite, Undaunted offers a better service for 40k a year. By placing robotic dogs around the property and hooking up to the security cameras, Undaunted can monitor and deploy dogs whenever necessary. At certain sites (especially in south Atlanta) these dogs are deployed super often to greet and deter either those trespassing or loitering at odd times. At sites with Undaunted, crime drops precipitously.  So, I need to find a way to mitigate overheating errors. As trivial as it sounds, the simplest solution to this problem is to turn the robots off and back on again. Unfortunately, this can’t be done virtually and it is expensive to send a technician out there for the flood of errors the dogs were having. The solution: a physical mechanism attached to the back of the dogs capable of physically turning the dogs off and back on. There is already a payload on the back of the dogs that can easily house the communication technology for this device but the mechanism to turn the dogs off and on is on the side of the robot. Something needs to attach to the side of the dog and hold a motor that connects to the payload. The best way to make this niche shape is definitely 3d printing. So, I learn CAD (computer automated design) and print off the first iteration. While this first design didn’t quite fit and had pillars that were too large, it came to hold a lot of sentimental value. In fact, this piece sits right on top of a cabinet in my room. This original piece would only ever travel from work to my house.  Fortunately, subsequent works would get continuously better until the mechanism was finished. After all the electrical and communication stuff was properly tuned, it was time to deploy. Over a week, the power cycling mechanism was deployed to over 10 robots throughout Atlanta. This piece and its derivatives help keep communities safe in high-risk areas.
067	Essay	Society and Culture	Persuasive	Write an essay comparing and contrasting the historical accuracy of two WW2 movies	A Delicate Balance: Weighing Historical Accuracy and Storytelling in Saving Private Ryan and The Imitation Game  With over 70 million people dead worldwide, World War Two was one of the most consequential events in all of human history. As a result, many movies have been made aiming to capture a portion of what occurred over the six years. Shining a light on the intelligence and cryptographic side of the war, The Imitation Game directed by Morten Tyldom, covers the life story of Alan Turing and his contributions to cracking encrypted German messages. On the other side of things, Saving Private Ryan directed by Steven Spielberg, focuses on the warfare element with its militaristic realism and themes of sacrifice. While Saving Private Ryan takes creative liberties in fictional storytelling to accurately depict the brutal realism of World War Two, The Imitation Game blurs the line between fact and fiction concerning the process of cracking the Enigma code. This choice misrepresents some figures and processes, as a result, its balance of storytelling and historical accuracy is less successful compared to Saving Private Ryan.  Even though Saving Private Ryan is centered around a fictional subplot, the passionate attention to detail in accurately portraying combat scenes creates an immersive experience. Saving Private Ryan follows the fictional story of how the U.S. Army Chief of Staff hears about one mother who lost three of her four sons in World War Two. The Army Chief of Staff then authorizes a mission to recover and return home the last remaining brother, Private Ryan. While this specific family is fictional, the situation of sending home one brother after three have been presumed dead occurred in World War Two with the Niland brothers. Another place Spielberg exercised his artistic liberty is with the final battle at a fictional town named Ramelle. While the characters and one battle are made up, the film holds true to the D-Day Normandy Invasion. To capture the realism and intensity of the Omaha Beach landing, Spielberg dedicated 25 of the movie’s 61 filming days to the 23 minute long opening scene. He hired real amputees to depict the gruesome injuries, employed over a thousand extras, and used two boats that landed in the real 1944 invasion. On top of that, the gunfire audio is recorded from World War Two era weapons. While the central plot is fictional, Saving Private Ryan holds impressively true to World War Two era combat and the Normandy Invasion Beach scene.  While The Imitation Game captures the larger idea in cracking the Enigma code, it fails to credit all the highly influential people and misrepresents Alan Turing. Alan Turing, Joan Clarke, and Hugh Alexander did work on the Hut 8 team to crack the German Enigma encryption machine. The Imitation Game develops this historical event alongside social drama between characters centered around an awkward and abrasive Alan Turing. While Turing was not particularly socially intelligent, the film overplays his awkwardness to emphasize the popular theme of a misunderstood genius. This directing choice misrepresents who Turing actually was. Although somewhat reserved, Turing was warm and kind. In fact, one of Turing’s colleagues during the war described Turing as “a very easily approachable man.” The warm side of Turing was strategically excluded from the film in order to allow for more drama and strife between Turing and his coworkers. Next, Turing’s machine was not named Christopher after his childhood crush, the Enigma cracking machine was named Bombe. Also, Alan Turing and Gordon Welchman co-invented the Bombe, yet in The Imitation Game Gordon Welchman is not mentioned once. Tyldom excludes Welchman to focus on the story of Turing and continue to develop the theme of a misunderstood genius unable to collaborate with others. The Imitation Game roughly explains the story of cracking Enigma, but fails to credit the co-creator of the Bombe while also severely misrepresenting Turing’s person.  Directors in Saving Private Ryan and The Imitation Game take different approaches to balance quality storytelling and historical accuracy. Saving Private Ryan creates a realistic yet fictional mission along with fictional characters to accurately illustrate the brutality of World War Two combat and D-Day. On the other hand, The Imitation Game tells the story of how Britain broke Germany’s Enigma encryption machine, through real, although misrepresented historical figures. Alan Turing is placed at the center of the story and treated as the sole contributor and inventor of the Bombe, when in reality he co-invented the Bombe with Gordon Welchman along with the help of others. The exclusion of Welchman and other’s help with Bombe decreases the film’s historical accuracy but allows for a more dramatic individual-focused plot. Treating Bombe only as Turing’s creation allows it to be a point of strife among the other cryptographers in the film. Although fictional characters, Spielberg hones in on much that is historically accurate while driving an inspiring narrative in Saving Private Ryan. From using real D-Day boats, building accurate uniforms, and recording actual gunfire from real weapons, Saving Private Ryan stands out as a pillar in the war film genre for its brutal realism and accuracy. Spielberg went to great lengths, both in time and financially, in order to properly represent and honor the great American soldiers killed in World War Two. Both authors take liberties in their production, but Saving Private Ryan’s attention to detail concerning warfare and D-Day while not mischaracterizing any real person makes it a more effective tribute when compared to The Imitation Game.  Saving Private Ryan, with fictional characters yet historically accurate combat and D-Day, outshines The Imitation Game in balancing historical accuracy and quality storytelling. Unlike Saving Private Ryan, The Imitation Game uses historical figures to drive the real narrative of cracking the German Enigma machine, but some characters are misrepresented or outright omitted in the film. The Imitation Game misconstrues Alan Turing’s personality and  damages his public image, portraying him as someone who, although intelligent, is awkward and abrasive. On top of that, the co-inventor of the Bombe, Gordon Welchman is never credited for his large contribution to cracking the Enigma machine. Saving Private Ryan creates realistic but fictional characters in order to tell an immersive story all while accurately portraying World War Two combat and D-Day.
068	Essay	Society and Culture	Persuasive	Write an essay on abondonment in Jane Eyre	"How Abandonment Created a Monster, Literally: Moral Ambiguity as a Result of Isolation in Frankenstein  Today, orphaned children are 55% more likely to become criminals. Over 200 years ago this generalization held true in Frankenstein, a book about a scientist who creates a living “monster” out of dead human parts. Similar to orphaning, the scientist Victor Frankenstein is disgusted by his creation and abandons it as soon as it comes to life. Victor’s abandonment significantly impacts the monster’s life and morality. In Frankenstein by Mary Shelley, the monster that Victor creates is morally ambiguous, existing somewhere between good and evil. The monster’s moral ambiguity works to illustrate the destructive consequences of isolation and abandonment.  Before Victor returns to his family after creating the monster, Shelley develops the monster’s moral ambiguity through his abandonment and interactions with the De Lacey family. The monster was abandoned by Victor when he began life. As a result, the monster is forced to navigate life and understand the world without anyone to help him. He learns English and initial morality through watching the De Lacey family. He learns a great deal watching them and initially wants to help others. He even collects firewood daily for the family when he sees that they are struggling. Yet as soon as the monster is denied a chance to join the family because of his looks, he resorts to violence, destroying part of a forest and declaring war on all of humanity. During his time watching the De Lacey family, the monster reaches what Jacques Lacan would describe as “the imaginary” where the monster constructs a sense of self and identity. As a result of the monster’s rejection from society and abandonment, he hates himself. The monster has learned that society hates him and therefore he believes he should hate himself too. This takes a toll on the monster and contributes to Shelley’s critique of abandonment by demonstrating the devastating effects it can have on youth. Furthermore, Shelley illustrates the monster’s dark side when he tracks down Victor’s family and murders Victor’s brother William out of fury for humanity. The monster’s time with the De Lacey family and his first murder work to depict him as a morally ambiguous character who has no definitive morals as a result of his abandonment and the lack of direction during development.  In the second part of the book, moral ambiguity is key as it allows Shelley to highlight the dubious outcome of a creator abandoning his creation. We see the good humanity in the monster when he longs for companionship. The monster makes a deal with Victor and agrees to never again harm anyone given that Victor builds the monster a companion. For over a year the monster is content with the hope of a brighter future. Yet when Victor decides not to go through with building a companion the monster gets enraged. Having no instilled morals due to a lack of developmental guidance, combined with his complete and utter isolation on earth, the monster resorts to the only means of expression he has, violence. The monster proceeds to kill Victor’s best friend, Henry Clerval. The monster is extremely isolated to the point where no one has ever shown him love. Having nothing to turn to, he resorts to the most basic and primitive reaction, violence. In the final chapters of the book, the monster discusses his life with Robert Walton. Here the monster reveals how he regretted all the death and destruction he caused during his time on earth. He states how he was blinded by raw hatred for Victor and the pain of life. The monster goes so far as to wish he never lived in the first place. This discussion reveals the extent to which Victor’s abandonment impacted the monster’s life. It destroyed his self-worth and he ended up regretting the totality of life because of the pain he experienced. Through the monster’s moral ambiguity, Shelley shows us that in a world where Victor did not abandon the monster, he could have grown to be a loving and positive force in the world. She contrasts this with his current violent and sad existence, highlighting the effects of abandonment. Furthermore, the fact that Victor gets tortured throughout the end of the novel suggests how Shelley did not approve of his abandonment and punishes him as such.  Shelley critiques abandonment through moral ambiguity because she was ""abandoned"" herself. Her mother died just after childbirth; consequently, she grew up without a mom. Frankenstein allows Shelley to highlight the consequences of abandonment through a fictional monster who is abandoned by his creator. The dubious morality of the monster as a result of his isolation allows Shelley to demonstrate the pain and confusion that those who are abandoned feel. In accordance with Jacques Lacan’s writings on the formation of identity, both the monster and Shelley herself went through “the imaginary” phase of life. In this phase an individual defines a sense of self based on what your world up to that point has shown you. For the monster and Shelley, they were betrayed and abandoned by their creators, and as a result, they saw themselves as something that is wrong, bad, or not deserving of love. The consequences of abandonment first become evident with these characters having little to no self-worth. However, the consequences develop further and we see the full-scale impact of abandonment and isolation on the monster, a symbol of Shelley herself. Furthermore, the consequences that Victor experiences in the end show what punishment Shelley believes those who abandon others should face."
069	Article	Society and Culture	Informative	What is one huge issue the US faces today?	National debt poses one of the greatest risks to the future of America. Why? Well at some point America will be out of money and no one will be willing to lend us money like they do now. In this case we would be unable to fund social services, healthcare, or any other critical government function. Currently, if the US halted all social services and halted all Medicare/medicaid payments it would take 8-10 years to pay off all the current debt. That’s over 37 trillion US dollars. To put that in perspective, that is enough money to pay for over 5 million years of Westminster tuition.   What caused this high level of national debt?  Wildly out of control government spending from the last two administrations. When covid hit the Trump administration took on lots of debt in order to stimulate the economy. When the Biden administration took over they continued this extremely elevated spending level for the next four years.   What can be done about it?  The best hope for the national debt is that the newly established department of government efficiency is ultra-effective in locating and eliminating waste, fraud, and abuse of taxpayer dollars, with minimal impact to critical services and functions of government.
